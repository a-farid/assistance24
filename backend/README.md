### **Backend** ✅
- Framework: **FastAPI**
- Notifications: Email-based notifications using **FastAPI-Mail**.

### **Database**
- Relational Database: **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage.

### **Cache**
- **Redis**: For performance optimization and queuing notifications.


### **Phase 1: Define Requirements and Architecture**
1. Design a relational database schema:
   - `Users`: Stores user data (roles: Admin, Worker, Client). ✅
   - `Clients`: Stores client details. ✅
   - `Workers`: Stores worker details. ✅
   - `Contracts`: Contracts between workers and clients with detailed hours count and sessions. ✅
   - `Meetings`: Records work hours, descriptions, and statuses (pending, approved, declined). ✅
2. Plan the API endpoints:
   - Authentication: `/auth` (login, logout, registration).
   - CRUD for clients, workers, and assignments.
   - Logging work hours: `/work-logs`.
   - Notifications: `/notifications`.
   - Reports: `/reports` (monthly reports).

### **Phase 2: Backend Development (FastAPI)**
1. **Authentication**:
   - Implement OAuth2 with JWT for secure login.
   - Role-based access control.
2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Manage accounts (Admin-only):
     - Create, update, and delete client/worker accounts.
   - Assign workers to clients.
   - Record and retrieve work logs.
   - Generate monthly reports:
     - Include total hours worked and descriptions for each client and worker.
3. **Notifications**:
   - Integrate `FastAPI-Mail` for email notifications.
   - Notify clients and admins when workers submit logs.
   - Notify workers when clients approve or decline logs.
4. **Database Integration**:
   - Use **SQLAlchemy** or **Tortoise ORM** to interact with PostgreSQL.
5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests using `pytest`.


### **Phase 4: Notification System**
1. Implement email notifications with **FastAPI-Mail**:
   - Setup email provider (e.g., Gmail or SendGrid).
   - Notify all relevant users upon work log submissions or actions.
2. Ensure notifications are queued efficiently with Redis (optional).
